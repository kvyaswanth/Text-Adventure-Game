# Escape Mars

Escape Mars is a text-based adventure game where you play as an astronaut on a critical mission to save Earth. You've landed on Mars and must find a mysterious "Healer element" to bring back to your home planet. The game features three key locations: the Launch Site where your rocket awaits, a vast Crater hiding a crucial key, and a locked Mine containing the Healer element. You must navigate these Martian landscapes using a map, unlock the mine with the found key, retrieve the Healer element, and successfully launch your rocket back to Earth. The game combines exploration, puzzle-solving, and a race against time, challenging players to think strategically and use the right items at the right moments to complete their mission and save humanity.

In the harsh, red landscape of Mars, your adventure unfolds across three distinct locations. The Launch Site serves as your starting point and ultimate goal, dominated by the sleek, powerful rocket that brought you here and holds the promise of return. A Martian map found here is your lifeline, guiding you through the alien terrain. To the east lies a vast Crater, its rocky expanse hiding secrets and dangers. Here, a rusty key glints among the stones, its purpose yet unknown but clearly important. Following the map south from the Crater, you'll find the entrance to a mysterious Mine. Dark and cavernous, its walls glitter with strange minerals, but your focus is on the Healer element hidden within its depths. This glowing substance is the key to Earth's salvation and the primary objective of your perilous mission. Each location presents its own challenges and atmosphere, from the technological haven of the Launch Site to the desolate expanse of the Crater and the foreboding depths of the Mine. Your journey through this Martian landscape will test your wit and courage as you seek to gather the items necessary to complete your mission and save humanity.
